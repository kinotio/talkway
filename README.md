Talkway is not just another messaging app; it's a vibrant community where ideas flow, friendships blossom, and collaboration thrives. With intuitive features and a user-friendly interface, Talkway empowers you to engage in conversations that matter, whether you're connecting with friends, colleagues, or like-minded individuals from around the world.

## Getting Started

First, because we use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as Package Manager we need to install it first:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v1.0.0"
```

Second, install deps:

```bash
bun install
```

And for the last , you can run the server with this command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Join Talkway today and experience the power of meaningful conversations. Let's talk the Talkway!
